# RSA-Encryption-cryptosystem
**Public Key Cryptography**
**RSA** (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is the oldest **public-key** cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. RSA is a relatively slow algorithm. It is not commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA is used to transmit shared keys for symmetric key cryptography, which are then used for bulk encryption-decryption. 

To this day the RSA algorithm is still impossible to crack due to the "factoring problem". (When used with large prime numbers p and q)
We are unable to factor the product of two large prime numbers in P time complexity.
